# General instructions #

Template structure:

/assets/bootstrap -- original Bootstrap files
/assets/css -- compiled CSS files
/assets/less -- source LESS files
/assets/js -- custom JS scripts
/assets/plugins -- third-party plugins
/assets/img -- images
/assets/ico -- favicon image

Q: How do I create a new page?
A: You can start with dummy.html. It contains the general wireframe, which includes navbar, sidebar, and footer.

Q: How do I edit the styles?
A: You can either work with vanilla CSS or source LESS files included. For vanilla CSS, please open assets/css/styles.css. Source LESS files are located at assets/less/. If you work with LESS files, after the changes are done, you only need to compile the main styles.less file located at assets/less/styles.less. This is the main LESS file that imports all of the other LESS files (including original Bootstrap source LESS files). Please visit http://lesscss.org/usage/index.html#third-party-compilers to find out how you can compile LESS files to CSS.

Q: How do I change the color scheme?
A: Changing a color scheme is easy with LESS. Please open /assets/less/components/colors.less, change the value of the @brand-primary and @brand-accent variables (also light and dark versions of those) and recompile the main styles.less file.

Q: How do I set up the contact form?
A: 

This template contains a fully functioning PHP contact form with spam protection powered by reCaptcha. Note: The contact form will not work in your local environment without a server that supports PHP. In order to set up the contact form, please follow the steps below:

1) Open config.php and fill out the required information:

 - reCaptcha Site ($publickey) and Secret ($privatekey) keys

Please go to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create if you don't have the keys yet.

 - Sender name and email address ($mail_sender)

This is a name and email address you will see in the "From:" line of new emails you will receive.

 - Your email address ($to_email)

This is an email address new emails will be sent to.

 - Email subject ($mail_subject)

This is a subject of new emails you will receive.

2) Insert your reCaptcha Site key (see Step 1) in /contact.html:


```
#!html

<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="YOUR_SITE_KEY"></div>
<!-- (e.g. <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="09sdv0sf9v0sdf9b0df9b09dfb"></div>) -->
```

3) Save all files.
